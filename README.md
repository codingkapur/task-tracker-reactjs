## DESCRIPTION:

The Task Tracker is a basic application which allows the user to add tasks to be done along with a date and time stamp.
It also allows the user to mark tasks as active or completed, which is indicated by a change of the background color.
The user can also delete tasks from the list of task.

## PURPOSE OF BUILDING THIS PROJECT:

The purpose behind building this project is to learn ReactJs, by understanding and developing comfort with the syntax.
This is a rebuild of a tutorial/code along I followed on youtube by a channel called Traversy Media.
The rebuild will be done without reference to the video, and unless stuck, the code. The objective is to gauge understanding of concepts and ability to use the ReactJs teachnology to build basic applications.

### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

This project is also important for the following reasons:
- it is the first time a README file has been written for a project by me.
- this project will be created with the best possible version control practice using Git. 
    - Files will be tracked.
    - Files will be committed after appropriate changes in code to make commit messages effective and concise.
    - Files will be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub.
- a mock database has been created using json server which serves a json file. all data actions are made on the json data to simulate data coming from a backend.
