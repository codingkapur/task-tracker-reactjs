PROJECT TITLE:

TASK TRACKER built with REACT.JS

HOW TO INSTALL PROJECT;
Prequisite: Node 14
Node version: 
1. Run command 'git clone https://github.com/codingkapur/task-tracker-reactjs.git'
2. Run command 'npm install"
3. run command 'npm run server'
4. run command 'npm start'

DESCRIPTION:

The Task Tracker is a basic application which allows the user to add tasks to be done along with a date and time stamp.
It also allows the user to mark tasks as active or completed, which is indicated by a change of the background color.
The user can also delete tasks from the list of task.

PURPOSE OF BUILDING THIS PROJECT:

The purpose behind building this project is to learn ReactJs, by understanding and developing comfort with the syntax.
This is a rebuild of a tutorial/code along I followed on youtube by a channel called Traversy Media.
The rebuild will be done without reference to the video, and unless stuck, the code. The objective is to gauge understanding of concepts and ability to use the ReactJs teachnology to build basic applications.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

This project is also important for the following reasons:
- it is the first time a README file has been written for a project by me.
- this project will be created with the best possible version control practice using Git. 
    - Files will be tracked.
    - Files will be committed after appropriate changes in code to make commit messages effective and concise.
    - Files will be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub.
- a mock database has been created using json server which serves a json file. all data actions are made on the json data to simulate data coming from a backend.

WHAT HAVE I LEARNED IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING THIS PROJECT:
(To be updated along the way)

1. React is a component based system for designing modern interactive user interfaces. Every element can be made into a component and it is only upto the user to which depth components are to be nested. That implies that the element in the user interface gets its own file where it is described, and then imported into the main app, or parent app, for rendering. This allows for seperation of code, for better organization, reusability and ease of maintainence.
2. Componenets are in the .js format, stored in a folder called components, placed in the src folder. Convention dictates that the file name of the component file should be capitalized. Such a file is composed of a function. It 
3. A js file in the components folder will return one html element. If there are more than one elements, they should be nested wihtin one parent element (like a div, or even empty structure like <> Place Elements here</>). Component file exports the function "export default (functionName)".
4. Components are imported into the file where they are used by saying "import (function name) from ('./components/function name').






This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
